. coolection of similar set of variables
. arrays are vector variables
initialisation can be done fo r only a few values
eg: 
  int a[5]={2,4};  wil 2,4,0,0,0 all ungiven value will be 0
  int a[]={n1,n2,n3..} the size will be the number of elements

Accessing elemnet
A[2], 2[A], *(A+2)

Static vs Dynamic array
* once array created size cant be modified
* in cpp size of array can be modified at run time in c not possible like gertting the size using cin and declaring llike a[n] = {} but in c n should always be an interger like a[5]

Arry from heap(dynamic array): A pointer is always needed to read memmory from heap
cpp -> int *p; p=new int[5];
c -> int *p; p=(int *)malloc(5*sizeof(int));  # here (int *) is for type casting as with malloc a memmory block only will be allocated 

deallocataion heap (memmory leak will occur if not)

cpp -> delete []p
c -> free(p)


ARRAY CANNOT BE RESIZED BUT HEAP ARRAY CAN BE RESIZED IN A DIFFERENT WAY

int *p,*q;
p = new int[3]
p[0]=1;p[1]=2;p[3]=1;
q = new int[5];
for(i=0;i<5;i++){
    q[i]=p[i];
}
# to free the space already occupied by p
delete []p;
p=q;
q=NULL
