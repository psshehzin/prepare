Linked lists and normal lists (like Python's built-in list) are both data structures used to store collections of elements. However, they have different advantages and disadvantages depending on the use case. Below are some of the key advantages of linked lists over normal lists:

1. Dynamic Size:
Linked List: Linked lists can easily grow or shrink in size by simply adding or removing nodes. Memory allocation for linked lists is dynamic, which means you don't need to allocate a fixed amount of memory beforehand.
Normal List: In contrast, a normal list like Python's list has a fixed capacity when initially created. While Python's list can grow dynamically, this often involves resizing and copying the entire list to a new memory location, which can be inefficient for large lists.
2. Efficient Insertions and Deletions:
Linked List: Inserting or deleting elements, especially at the beginning or middle of a linked list, is efficient (O(1) time complexity) because it only requires changing a few pointers. This makes linked lists particularly useful for applications that involve frequent insertions and deletions.
Normal List: In a normal list, inserting or deleting elements in the middle or beginning requires shifting all subsequent elements, which is an O(n) operation.
3. Memory Utilization:
Linked List: Memory allocation for linked lists is on-demand (node by node), so there's no need to allocate a large block of contiguous memory. This can be more memory-efficient if the exact size of the list is unknown or changes frequently.
Normal List: Normal lists require a contiguous block of memory. If the list grows beyond its current capacity, the entire list needs to be copied to a new, larger block of memory, which can be expensive in terms of time and space.
4. Efficient Memory Management:
Linked List: Linked lists allocate memory for each element as it is added, which can prevent wastage of memory compared to normal lists that might allocate more space than necessary.
Normal List: In a normal list, there can be unused memory if the list doesn't fill its allocated capacity. On the other hand, resizing when capacity is exceeded can be inefficient.
5. No Predefined Size:
Linked List: Linked lists don't require an initial size declaration. You can keep adding elements without worrying about running out of space.
Normal List: Although Pythonâ€™s list dynamically resizes, it might need to reallocate memory if the list grows beyond its current capacity, which can lead to performance hits.
6. Better Performance in Certain Scenarios:
Linked List: Linked lists can be more efficient than normal lists when the application requires frequent insertions and deletions in the middle or beginning of the list, or when the size of the list is constantly changing.
Normal List: Normal lists are less efficient in scenarios where many elements need to be inserted or deleted frequently, especially in large datasets.
When to Prefer Linked Lists Over Normal Lists:
Frequent Insertions/Deletions: When your application requires frequent insertions or deletions at arbitrary positions within the list, linked lists can be more efficient.
Unknown or Dynamic Size: If the size of the collection is dynamic or unknown, linked lists avoid the need for resizing operations.
Memory Constraints: In scenarios where memory is fragmented or limited, linked lists may offer better utilization of available memory.
Trade-offs:
While linked lists have these advantages, they also have some disadvantages compared to normal lists, such as:

Slower Access Times: Linked lists have slower access times (O(n)) for random elements because you need to traverse the list from the head to the desired node.
Higher Memory Usage: Linked lists use extra memory for storing pointers along with the data.
Thus, the choice between a linked list and a normal list depends on the specific requirements of your application.
